# Linear-Regression

Analyzing the Boston housing dataset to understand factors affecting median house prices. The dataset includes various variables like crime rate, land proportion, accessibility to highways , property-tax rate and more. The goal is to use linear regression to understand the factors influencing the house prices. We also explore multiple regression and understand how t-value is computed and what hypothesis it tests. Tasks include data cleaning, regression modeling, hypothesis testing and interpretation of results.
